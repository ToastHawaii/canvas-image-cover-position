# Canvas image cover position
This method is helpful for calculating image position for scaling it on the canvas. A behavior is the same as css property 'background-size: cover;'

```javascript
canvasImageCoverPosition(
    imageNaturalWidth,
    imageNaturalHeight,
    canvasWidth,
    canvasHeight,
    [offsetLeft, offsetTop]
)
```
If the offsets are not specified, the image is centered
## Installation

**or**

```bash

    image.naturalHeight,
    canvas.width,
    canvas.height,
    0.5,
    0.5
);
canvas.getContext('2d').drawImage(
    image,
    imagePosition.offsetLeft,
    imagePosition.offsetTop,
